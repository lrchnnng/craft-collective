                    A: While we love the idea of a brick-and-mortar store filled with our handcrafted treasures, we're
                    currently an online-only operation! This allows us to keep our overhead costs low, which means we
                    can keep our jewellery pieces affordable and accessible for you. We understand some folks miss the
                    in-person experience, but we hope our detailed product descriptions and photos bring the beauty of
                    our pieces to life!

                    However, we do participate in occasional pop-up markets and events. Keep an eye on our social media
                    pages and website announcements for upcoming opportunities to see our collections in person!
